### Installation

Note: This surface has been created and tested to work on Live version `11.3.21`. Use this control surface to make the following changes to Artutia's default MiniLab 3 behaviours:

* 🟪 👉 ❌ Shift + Loop button deletes the current selected clip
* 🟧 👉 ⏰ Shift + Tap button toggles the metronome click

To install the Control Surface in Ableton:

1. Navigate to your Control Surface directory:
* Mac: `/Applications/Music/Ableton Live 11.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts`
* Windows: `\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Ableton\Live x.x.x\Preferences\User Remote Scripts`
2. Back up your `/MiniLab_3` folder (keep a copy to revert to zipped up somewhere)
3. Replace with the `/ableton/MiniLab_3` folder in this repo
4. Restart Ableton Live and select the MiniLab 3 as your Control Surface in the MIDI preferences
5. If the tempo Shift + Tap button has turned orange, you're good to go. 👍
